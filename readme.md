# Have Chips

Have Chips is DCS World multiplayer PvPvE dynamic mission system

### **Mission**

Develop a dynamic DCS multiplayer persistent mission system

### **Vision**

Engaging and enjoyable DCS multiplayer experience which can easily be customized with minimum or no code modification.Â 

Focus is on playability not trying to create a comprehensive strategic conflict simulator. That being said, level of realism and difficulty is completely up to you it is just that no attempt is being made to simulate strategic level of conflict for two reasons:  
DCS isn't built for that, if strategic supply simulation is your thing use Exel or SAP or Matlab...you get the point :)

### **Goals**

**Templating system** enables creating different scenarios using DCS Mission Editor

*   Easy to customize player planeset, weaponset  
    Player planeset and weapons configuration is done ONE place in editor, no need to configure individual bases/FARPS
*   Easy to customize player planeset, weaponset  
    AI planeset configuration is done in editor by placing groups appropriate template zones
*   Strategic zones (Airbases/FARPs) configurable in editor  
    Strategic zones are configured by setting ownership to airfields/FARPS to RED or BLUE in mission editor. HC will find those on first mission run, and take care of persistence accross mission iterations.

**24/7 living battlefield** driven by "AI" makes it possible to jump in and have fun regardless of how many human players are present

*   AI will always provide action yet won't overwhelm the players
*   AI will be the "background" of PvP action providing mission opportunities, support as well as opposition to players

**Interactive mission menu** drives players to concrete objectives giving each sortie a purpose

*   Players can choose mission targets suggested by HC and get rewards when mission is completed
*   Completing missions allows players to take advantage of additional benfits like ask AI escort, JTAC etc

**Player persistent career** progression unlocks additional in game perks like additional mission choices or AI support options
